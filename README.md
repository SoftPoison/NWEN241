Assignment 1:
- Task 9:
  - you do not need to implement the functions just write out the function with empty body and add comments to them would be good enough. Missed the wrap and the line numbering methods in your part3.cc file

Assignment 2:
- Task 1:
  - part 1 just needs to be float\* fb
- Task 3:
  - this does not explain what is happening with the pointers
- Task 8:
  - failed tests when position array was null
  - needed to stop checking at end of position array not buffer
- Task 11:
  - failed tests when position array was null
  - needed to stop checking at the end of the position array not the buffer

    test\_task7\_normal\_case0 failed:
    test\_assignment3.cc:244: 1 expected but was 0
    Expected return value : 1
    Actual return value : 1

    Records between the expected and actual tables did not matched at row equal to 1!!
